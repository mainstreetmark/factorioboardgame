# factorioboardgame

## About

Have you played Factorio? It's a fairly complicated game of logistics which has tickled both my programmer brain, and my love of SimCity style games. The initial goal is to launch a rocket, which took perhaps 80 hours of gameplay to achieve. And that was just the first factory.

However, I have a family, and stuff...

Since we have decided to spend way less time in front of the screen this year, we instituted some board game nights. I've been playing lots of Sorry! and Game of Life, both of which I hate.

So how do I combine the resolution of increasing board-game time, and decreasing screen time? Combine the two (by spending a crapload of additional screen time developing this thing).
